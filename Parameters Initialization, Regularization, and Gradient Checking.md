## Parameter Initialization

### $Why ~ Proper ~ Initialization ~ Matters$

Parameter initialization is critical for successful deep learning training. Poor initialization can lead to:
- **Vanishing gradients**: Gradients become exponentially small in deep networks
- **Exploding gradients**: Gradients become exponentially large
- **Symmetry breaking**: All neurons learn the same features
- **Slow convergence**: Training takes much longer to reach optimal solutions

### $The ~ Mathematical ~ Foundation$

For proper signal propagation through deep networks, we need to maintain the variance of activations and gradients across layers. The key insight is that _the variance of a layer's output should be approximately equal to the variance of its input._

**Forward Pass Variance Preservation:**  

$$Var(output) ≈ Var(input)$$  

**Backward Pass Variance Preservation:**  

$$Var(gradient) ≈ Var(upstream\_gradient)$$

### $Common ~ Initialization ~ Methods$

#### 1. Zero Initialization ❌
```python
W = np.zeros((n_in, n_out))
```
**Problem**: All neurons learn identical features due to _perfect symmetry_, essentially learning the same parameters, which makes it no different from a regular _machine learning model_ ($1$ layer, $1$ neuron).

#### 2. Random Small Values ❌
```python
W = np.random.randn(n_in, n_out) * 0.01
```
**Problem**: Activations and gradients shrink exponentially in deep networks, which causes _vanishing gradients_.

#### 3. Xavier/Glorot Initialization ✅
**Best for**: Tanh and Sigmoid activation functions

**Normal Distribution:**
```python
W = np.random.randn(n_in, n_out) * np.sqrt(1.0 / n_in)
```

**Uniform Distribution:**
```python
limit = np.sqrt(6.0 / (n_in + n_out))
W = np.random.uniform(-limit, limit, (n_in, n_out))
```

**Mathematical Justification:**
- Maintains unit variance for both forward and backward pass
- Derived assuming linear activations (works well for tanh/sigmoid)

#### 4. He Initialization ✅
**Best for**: ReLU and its variants

**Normal Distribution:**
```python
W = np.random.randn(n_in, n_out) * np.sqrt(2.0 / n_in)
```

**Uniform Distribution:**
```python
limit = np.sqrt(6.0 / n_in)
W = np.random.uniform(-limit, limit, (n_in, n_out))
```

**Mathematical Justification:**
- Accounts for the fact that ReLU kills half the neurons on average
- Factor of 2 compensates for the reduced variance due to ReLU

#### 5. Modern Initialization Strategies

**LeCun Initialization** (for SELU):
```python
W = np.random.randn(n_in, n_out) * np.sqrt(1.0 / n_in)
```

**Orthogonal Initialization** (for RNNs):
```python
# Uses orthogonal matrices to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients
W = orthogonal_matrix(n_in, n_out)
```

### Bias Initialization

**Standard Practice:**
```python
b = np.zeros(n_out)  # Initialize biases to zero
```

**Exception for ReLU:**
```python
b = np.full(n_out, 0.01)  # Small positive bias to ensure initial activation
```  

## Regularization Techniques

Regularization prevents overfitting by adding constraints or noise to the learning process, helping models generalize better to unseen data.

### $1. ~ L_1 ~ and ~ L_2 ~ Regularization$

#### L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)
**Most Common**: Penalizes large weights by adding their squared magnitude to the loss.

**Mathematical Form:**  

$$ J_{regularized} = J_{original} + \frac{\lambda}{2m} ~ \sum^m W^2 $$

**Implementation:**
```python
# In loss function
l2_penalty = 0.5 * lambda_reg * np.sum(W**2)
total_loss = original_loss + l2_penalty

# In gradient computation
dW += lambda_reg * W
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents weights from becoming too large
- Encourages weight sharing
- Smooth decision boundaries

#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)
**Sparsity-Inducing**: Promotes sparse weights (many weights become exactly zero).

**Mathematical Form:**  

$$ J_{regularized} = J_{original} + \frac{\lambda}{m} ~ \sum^m \left| W \right| $$

**Implementation:**
```python
# In loss function
l1_penalty = lambda_reg * np.sum(np.abs(W))
total_loss = original_loss + l1_penalty

# In gradient computation
dW += lambda_reg * np.sign(W)
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic feature selection
- Sparse models (smaller memory footprint)
- Interpretable models

### $2. ~ Dropout$

**Core Idea**: Randomly set a fraction of neurons to zero during training, forcing the network to learn redundant representations.

**Mathematical Formulation:**  
During training:  
```python
h_dropout = h * mask / keep_prob
```
where $\text{mask} \approx \text{Bernoulli(keep-prob)} $  

During inference:  
```python
h_inference = h  # No dropout, but scaled during training
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def dropout_forward(X, keep_prob, training=True):
    if training:
        mask = np.random.binomial(1, keep_prob, X.shape) / keep_prob
        return X * mask, mask
    else:
        return X, None

def dropout_backward(dout, mask):
    return dout * mask
```

**Key Parameters:**
- **keep_prob**: Probability of keeping a neuron (typically 0.5-0.8)
- **Inverted dropout**: Scale activations during training (modern approach)  

The division by `keep_prob` is called **inverted dropout** and it's crucial for maintaining the expected value of activations:  
>**Without Inverted Dropout:**  
>- **Training:** `E[X_dropout] = keep_prob * E[X]` (scaled down)
>- **Testing:** `E[X_test] = E[X]` (original scale)
>- **Problem:** _Different scales_ between training and testing!
>
>**With Inverted Dropout:**  
>- **Training:** `E[X_dropout] = E[X * mask / keep_prob] = E[X] * E[mask] / keep_prob = E[X] * keep_prob / keep_prob = E[X]`
>- **Testing:** `E[X_test] = E[X]` (no dropout applied)
>- **Benefit:** _Same expected scale_ in both training and testing!  

**Modern Standard:**  
The inverted dropout (scaling during training) is now the standard approach because:  
1. **No inference overhead:** No need to scale during testing
2. **Cleaner implementation:** Test time is just forward pass without modifications
3. **Framework compatibility:** All major frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) use this approach

**Benefits:**
- Reduces overfitting significantly
- Improves generalization
- Acts as ensemble method (averaging multiple sub-networks)

**Modern Considerations:**
- Often not needed with batch normalization
- Can increase training time
- Less effective in very deep networks with proper normalization

### $3. ~ Batch ~ Normalization$

**Revolutionary Technique**: Normalizes _inputs to each layer_, dramatically improving training stability and speed.

**Mathematical Formulation:**  

$$ \begin{align} 
\text{Batch mean: } \quad & \mu_B = \frac 1 m \times \sum^m X \\
\text{Batch variance: } \quad & \sigma^2_B = \frac 1 m \times \sum^m~(X - \mu_B)^2 \\      
\text{Normalize: } \quad & \hat X = \frac{X - \mu_B} {\sqrt{\sigma^2_B + \epsilon}} \\
\text{Scale and shift: } \quad & Y = \gamma \times \hat X + \beta 
\end{align} $$

**Implementation:**
```python
def batch_norm_forward(X, gamma, beta, eps=1e-8):
    mu = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    var = np.var(X, axis=0)
    X_norm = (X - mu) / np.sqrt(var + eps)
    out = gamma * X_norm + beta
    
    # Cache for backward pass
    cache = (X, X_norm, mu, var, gamma, beta, eps)
    return out, cache
```

**Benefits:**
- **Accelerates training**: Often 2-10x faster convergence
- **Reduces sensitivity to initialization**: Can use higher learning rates
- **Regularization effect**: Reduces need for dropout
- **Gradient flow**: Helps with vanishing gradient problem

**Modern Usage:**
- Standard in most CNN architectures
- Applied after linear transformation, before activation
- Learnable parameters γ (scale) and β (shift)

### $4. ~ Early ~ Stopping$

**Simple yet Effective**: Stop training when validation performance starts degrading.

**Benefits:**  
- Prevents overfitting without hyperparameter tuning
- Computationally efficient
- Works with any model architecture

### A complete reference implementation for **Early Stopping** is provided in the **[Implementation Examples](#implementation-examples) section**.

## Gradient Checking

**Purpose**: Verify that your backpropagation implementation is correct by comparing analytical gradients with numerical gradients.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Numerical Gradient (Two-sided difference):**  

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} \approx \frac{J(θ + \epsilon) - J(θ - \epsilon)}{2 \epsilon} $$  


where $\epsilon$ is a small value (typically $1e^{-7}$).  
**Relative Difference (between _analytical_ and _numerical_ gradients):**  

$$ \text{Difference} = \frac{||\text{Grad} - \text{Grad}_{approx}||_2} {||\text{Grad}||_2 + ||\text{Grad}_{approx}||_2} $$  

### Interpretation of Results

**Gradient Check Tolerance:**
- **difference < 1e-7**: Excellent! Your implementation is likely correct
- **1e-7 < difference < 1e-5**: Good. Probably correct, but double-check
- **1e-5 < difference < 1e-3**: Warning. Likely a bug in backpropagation
- **difference > 1e-3**: Error. Definitely a bug in your implementation

### Common Issues and Debugging Tips

1. **Regularization**: Don't forget to include regularization terms in both forward and backward pass
2. **Dropout**: Turn off dropout during gradient checking
3. **Batch Normalization**: Use the same batch for both forward passes
4. **Numerical Precision**: Use double precision (float64) for gradient checking
5. **Random Initialization**: Use fixed random seed for reproducibility

## Modern Best Practices

### $2024 ~ Recommendations$

1. **Initialization Strategy:**
   - **CNNs**: He initialization with ReLU activations
   - **Transformers**: Xavier initialization with layer normalization
   - **RNNs**: Orthogonal initialization for recurrent connections

2. **Regularization Hierarchy:**
   - **First choice**: Batch/Layer Normalization
   - **Second choice**: Weight decay (L2 regularization)
   - **Third choice**: Dropout (if needed)
   - **Always**: Early stopping

3. **Gradient Checking:**
   - Essential during development
   - Use only on small subsets of data
   - Disable all stochastic elements (dropout, batch norm in training mode)

### Framework-Specific Implementations

**PyTorch:**
```python
import torch.nn as nn

# He initialization
nn.init.kaiming_normal_(layer.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')

# Xavier initialization
nn.init.xavier_uniform_(layer.weight)

# Regularization
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 256),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),
    nn.Linear(256, 10)
)
```

**TensorFlow/Keras:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, initializers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal',
                kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01), use_bias=False),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Activation('relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
